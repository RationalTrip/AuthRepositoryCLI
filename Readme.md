This is a simple project that implements a Login Authentication repository using Dapper and CLI.

You can:
1. Check if the login already exists in the database.
2. Create a new authentication to database.
3. Sign in. In our case, if authentication was successful, you will get information about the user.

For database initialization you can use DbInit.sql query.
